This repo contains all the configuration files I have been gathering along my 
learning path in linux.

Thank you very much to the community who made all this learnings possible.

So far, it includes de configuration files for:
- NeoVim 
- Git
- tmux
- zsh (Oh-my-zsh)
- vim
- Robo 3T (AKA Robomongo)
